This program img_to_video converts folder of images into array and saves them as an .avi video file. 

For the program to work properly all images must be of same size and same file type(jpg, png, jpeg, ...) and in the right order you would like them to be converted.
In this  example l will be using x-ray images of an object with cracks in the middle in folder kos08_01_PNG. The video is saved in output path folder outPath as kos08_01_PNG.avi

P.S.
Due to kos08_01_PNG folder being to large I will only include few images for example and not the whole folder.
